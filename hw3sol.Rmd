Q- Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.
Ans- In the table we have created that shows the number of men and women in each education category, we observe that the less than high school and more than high school numbers are pretty similar for both the sexes (slightly more females in both categories). However, there is a significant difference in the number of men with high school equivalent education than women. It is also important to note that in our tidied dataset the number of men is more than the number of women (120 vs 111).

```

Q- describe the resulting dataset
Ans- We have a dataset with 8 columns. 99,485 rows. Duration is a number while weekdays have been set as a factor. The other variables have been set as characters. The dataset describes the details (time, duration, destination etc.) of the rides taken by someone in NYC via a citibike. The dataset, str() and summary() commands allow us to know more about the data and the details provided.

```{R}
table1 = citi_merged |>
  group_by(time, member_casual) |>
  summarize(total = n()) |>
  arrange(total)
table1
```

Q- Produce a reader-friendly table showing the total number of rides in each combination of year and month separating casual riders and Citi Bike members. Comment on these results.
Ans- Going off the total number of rides, in Jan 2020- the total casual rides were the least while July 2024 recorded the highest. The same is true for members.The fact that January is lower than July is pretty understandable considering the weather of NYC (cold winters). Even the latest number of rides (July 2024) for casual users was less in total than Citibike members. The proportion of members:users when considering rides has been decreasing over the years as there were 10 times members rides to casual users rides which is not around 3 times.

  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ month) +
  labs(title = "Median Ride Duration by Day of the Week, Month, and Year",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Median Ride Duration (minutes)",
       color = "Year")
```
Q- Make a plot to investigate the effects of day of the week, month, and year on median ride duration. This plot can include one or more panels, but should facilitate comparison across all variables of interest. Comment on your observations from this plot.

Ans- In 2020, the median duration of how long a bike was used was more than in 2024 for both months especially in July. 
Seeing the days of the week, we find that the median duration time of the bikes during the weekend decreased quite a bit in 2024 when compared to 2020.This decrease is more profound in July than January.Also for other days, the median duration is less in 2024 than 2020 with bigger difference in July. Something different about the weekend is that Saturdays and Sundays have similar duration in 2020 for both months. However, the duration for Sundays decreases more than Saturdays in 2024.



```{R}
data_2024 = citi_merged |>
  separate(time, into = c("month", "year"), sep = " ") |>
  filter(year == 2024)
data_2024
ggplot(data_2024, aes(x = month, y = duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ rideable_type) +
  labs(title = "Impact of Month, Membership Status, and Bike Type on Ride Duration",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Ride Duration (minutes)",
       fill = "Membership Status")
```
Q- For data in 2024, make a figure that shows the impact of month, membership status, and bike type on the distribution of ride duration. Comment on your results

Ans- For classic bikes we see that January and July do not show a lot of differences. The box plots are pretty similar for both casual users and members. 
However, in electric bikes there are some difference between the two months. The ride duration was more in July (for both members and casual users) compared to January. This can be seen by the fact that the boxes are slightly bigger and the median is higher when compared to their counterparts.
We also see that irrespective of the month and type of bike, casual users use the rideable for a longer time than members which is explained by the median of orange boxes being higher than the blue boxes.
It is hard to comment on whether classic bikes or electric bikes are used for longer duration. Observing the box plot we can say that classic bikes might be used for slightly longer ride duration.
